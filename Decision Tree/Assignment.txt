Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to perform binary classification on the hepatitis dataset using a Decision Tree classifier. Students will be required to read the dataset from a GitHub repository, build a Decision Tree model, and evaluate its performance using various metrics.
Dataset:
- Dataset Name: hepatitis.csv
- GitHub Repository: Attached

Task:
1. Data Loading:
   - Read the hepatitis dataset from the provided GitHub repository.
   - Explore the dataset and understand its structure.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle any missing values appropriately.
   - Encode the categorical variables if necessary.
   - Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y), where 1 indicates a positive case and 0 indicates a negative case.

3. Decision Tree Model:
   - Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing sets.
   - Build a Decision Tree classifier using a suitable library (scikit-learn).
   - Train the model on the training set.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Make predictions on the testing set.
   - Evaluate the model using the following metrics:
      - Confusion Matrix
      - Precision
      - Recall
      - F1 Score
      - AUC-ROC Score

5. Results and Analysis:
   - Summarize the results obtained from the evaluation metrics.
   - Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the Decision Tree model for this dataset.
